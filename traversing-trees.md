# Traversing Trees
  
## What is a tree?
A tree is a hierarchical way of representing data. The most intuitive way to understand a tree would probably be: a categorisation of elements into groups whose definitions get consecutively narrower.
We've been building trees our whole lives to store away some kinds of information. For example, we have one big bucket called 'animals'. Now under this, we have categories, say, 'micro-organisms', 'reptiles', 'birds', 'mammals' and so on. We keep dividing animals into smaller groups in this manner, until we reach the tree's leaves - individual animals that we can't (or don't want to) further divide into groups.

## How do you traverse - travel through - a tree?
If you saw a diagram of a tree, your eyes would scan the elements in the tree and make sense of it.
You would find the 'root' element, or the widest category (in the above example, 'animals'). After this, you could scan the next element in one of two ways
1. Depth-first: You see the first subcategory 'micro-organisms' and think "Ah, that's interesting! I like micro-organisms. They're so tiny and yet clearly, they can make the entire world grind to a halt for over a year." So now you're invested in micro-organisms and proceed to the subcategories under it. At each step, without looking at the neighbouring subcategories, you go one level deeper into the one you are already seeing.
2. Breadth-first: You look at 'micro-organisms' and like any normal people, you say "Eh. Moving on already." You look at all the sub-categories under 'animals'. (Maybe your attention span is dangerously low, maybe you want to acclimate yourself with what is to come before diving in too deep.) You scan the tree level-by-level, looking at all the subcategories in one level before moving on to the next.

## Extended Side-note aka what I did at college
If you immediately know you're really interested in those micro-organisms, it's all very well to do a depth-first traversal of this tree to find your favourite category to learn about. But if you're a little bit more like me, you'll spend your time doing a lot more of breadth-first than depth-first!
As it turns out, I learnt quite a lot by hopping from branch to branch:
- **How to Learn**  
Every time I met a new (problem), I had to develop a new knowledge base, sometimes even unlearn things; and in general, just get better at learning. I figured out what works for me - the right ratio of learning by doing, and playing two-roads-diverged-in-a-wood with videos and articles.
- **The Big Picture**  
If you think of the entire space of (problems) as a Rubik's cube, every branch-hop was like solving a new face of the cube while trying to keep the previous face intact. And every time, the bigger picture became (somewhat) clearer and the world became a (tangibly) better place.
- **What next?**  
As long as it took, I did chip away at the big question of "What next?" through the process of elimination. Some branches are just not the right fit for my claws, so I crossed them confidently (read: tentatively, to be revisited many times) off the list.
