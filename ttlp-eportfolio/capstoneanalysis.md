# Capstone Analysis

## Motivation

Working on the Learning from Foundations project with the Teaching and Learning Lab (TLL) allowed me to reflect on the ways in which taking the Foundations courses this summer have influenced my identity as an educator. How People Learn definitely played a role in my course selection: I wanted to understand how research in learning sciences informs the design of learning experiences, leading me to take the TLL Practicum course. But on a more fundamental level, How People Learn affirmed my identity as an educator: I found the vocabulary to express, and the research to support, certain _things_ that my intuition already told me.

My experiences as an educator at Sitara Akka played a large role in helping me develop this “intuition”. I’d learned a lot from working on projects at Sitara and perhaps even more from the community of passionate educators around me: the Core Team of Sitara.

I found myself wanting to pass on to this community some of what I’d learned through my courses at HGSE, but especially the feeling of affirmation. This, paired with my interest in creating a learning experience end-to-end, is what motivated my capstone: a learning session that I conducted for the members of the Core Team of Sitara.

## Context

Sitara is a social venture “committed to providing contextualized and meaningful education to underserved communities” (Sitara Akka, n.d.), located in Bangalore, India. The organization is 4+ years old and led by its Core Team members who are all young adults, in or recent graduates of college. Over these years of running the organization, they have accumulated a wealth of contextualized experience as educators. However, experience does not always equal expertise (Persky & Robinson, 2017). The founder, Shriya Shankar, has always been a strong proponent for creating an organizational culture of learning. In 2021, she started a series of informal learning sessions for the Core Team to promote research, discussion and reflection on topics related to Sitara’s work. I reason that these learning sessions were always a space for the team to reorganize their experience around a knowledge base and critically examine decisions made in the past for the purpose of improvement. This newly-connected knowledge, when reapplied to the work of the organization, allowed the team to engage in “deliberate practice” to build expertise (Persky & Robinson, 2017). Hence, I decided to design my capstone as a part of this series of learning sessions.

## Design Process

In a conversation with Katherine Farrar from the TLL (lead of the Learning from Foundations project I worked on), she pointed out, in good humor, the self-referential nature of my capstone work. I followed the design thinking process to design the learning session, and after multiple rounds of iteration, narrowed down on “Learner-Centered Design” as the topic of the learning session itself. The [capstone product](./capstoneproduct.md) is the final design iteration and includes the learning objectives, planned activities and learning session outline. The following sections narrate the design process undertaken to arrive at the final iteration and include explanations of design and media decisions.

### Choosing a Design Process

I started work on my capstone with a vague learning objective: to pass on to my learners any knowledge from my courses at HGSE that they would find relevant and useful. In an initial conversation with Katherine, we discussed that my design process had to be learner-centered, owing to the relevance objective; and dynamic, given that I was starting with almost no concrete information. The obvious choice was to follow a design thinking process (T127, 2022). I chose the 5-Step version; also called EDIPT for Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test (d.school, 2010); because I was familiar with it.

### Empathy Conversations

I started with a simple brainstorming exercise, where I noted down topics for the learning session that I thought might be connected to the work of Sitara in some way. Using this “topic map” as a reference, I had conversations with two members of the Core Team to understand what they might be interested in learning. 

**Learner Motivations**
1. They were most interested in understanding the process of learning design to guide their thinking as they developed curriculum and educational media
2. It was important to the team to be able to apply their learning to the design challenges they faced 

I wondered: could the session be focused on solving an authentic problem faced by the organization through the lens of learning design? This kind of situated learning would align well with the learner motivations, by coupling the accomplishment of a task - designing to solve an authentic problem, with the underlying competencies needed to carry out the task - understanding the process of learning design (Collins, 2005). I brought this up in my conversation with Srushti, and she mentioned that there had been a recent dip in volunteer engagement in one of the projects the organization was working on. According to the team, it seemed likely that the dip was caused by a decrease in energy levels post-COVID. Whatever the case, this lack of engagement had halted progress on the project. Srushti and I discussed that the learning session could include a design sprint focused on redesigning this project for increased volunteer engagement.  

After these conversations, I listed out learning objectives and started designing the session.

### Gallery Walk

I presented an infographic visualizing my work at the Gallery Walk, and this led to some useful feedback from my peers on
* Scoping: My learning objectives were initially too broad in scope, and had to be narrowed down based on the time constraint of the learning session (90-120 minutes).
* Media: A peer recommended cutting down on the readings I had planned to assign as pre-work. From their experience conducting learning sessions in India, it was their belief that the learners would not be motivated to do much work before the session itself.
These recommendations allowed me to iterate over the “definition” as well as “design” stages. 
* The feedback on scoping prompted me to revisit my learning objectives and think about “what’s worth learning” (HPL, 2022). I wanted the team to understand how a learning design framework is a way to think in a structured manner about design decisions. Given this, I picked a single framework to talk about: Learner-Centered Design.
* Based on the feedback about pre-work, I decided to include a short lecture accompanied by slides at the beginning of the session to explain the learner-centered design framework. I drew on some of Mayer’s principles of multimedia design (Walsh, 2017) while creating these slides
    * Coherence - keeping minimal text on the slides
    * Temporal Contiguity - presenting live and switching slides appropriately
    * Personalization - conversational tone, both with text and the lecture

### Assessment

In situated learning, the task that learners perform itself acts as a form of authentic assessment (Collins, 2005). Along with the design sprint, I designed a small reflection exercise that would help the team connect their learnings to their previous experiences in learning design, in keeping with the principle of “deliberate practice”, which emphasizes the importance of conscious effort and self-regulation in learning (Persky & Robinson, 2017).

## Conclusion

Through the above process, I came up with the final design as captured in the capstone product.
I conducted the learning session on December 11, 2022. The feedback received was generally positive and the team reported that the session met the learning objectives it was designed for. However, there were a few improvements suggested with regards to facilitation and the time allotted to various segments of the design sprint. I have planned a follow-up session post the winter break to complete a “project redesign prototype”. The plan is to incorporate these suggested improvements into the design process to improve the learning sessions iteratively.
