# Group Intimacy Learning Experience
A few days ago, I participated in a prototype of a group learning experience. This experience was designed to foster intimacy within the group of people who had signed up to participate. Through this reflective post, I wish to break down this session from the perspective of a learning designer, and argue for the "design thinking" framework as the best fit for this experience.

## Learning Objective
The objective was to foster "intimacy" within the group of participants - with the definition of intimacy being flexible, allowing participants to experience the session in their own ways.

## Details
There were 6 participants, of which some of us already knew each other (the people who knew each other came together only for full-group activities).

## Activities
There were three sets of activities, some in pairs and some full-group. These mostly involved trying to read non-verbal cues and meaning-making with other people. The most "intimate" part of the session, for me, was an activity called Pair Mirroring. We were asked to pair off with people we didn't already know, and the objective was for the pair to mirror each other's actions without any verbal signalling. I was surprised at how easily I was able to read another person's thought process just through eye contact and the pace at which they went through their motions. I felt that my partner was similarly able to read me in response (and she later confirmed this during the debriefing). I did feel like I developed a connection with her in those few minutes, even though I wouldn't neccessarily label that as "intimacy".

## Design Process
I had a  brief conversation with the team that designed the session. As I understood it, the followed the "backward design" process. Their goal was clearly articulated, and even shared with the participants at the beginning. They had a theory of action - that intimacy would be follow if the group was able to interact without any of the fears or preoccupations that sometimes come with social situations. They focused on creating a safe space, and the activities used our bodies as a medium to "disrupt" the status quo of what first-time interactions needed to look like. All of the activities were planned in support of this goal, and aligned with the theory of action.

## My Analysis
I argue that the situation might have called for a framework like "design thinking" instead of backward design.

The team collected survey data from the participants pre- and post- the session, but the information from the survey was not used to drive the team's understanding of the problem space.
For example, in the debrief that followed the session, some participants surfaced their thoughts: while they felt some kind of intimacy with the group at the end of the session, this kind might not be _useful_ outside the context of the session itself. They wished for an intervention that would allow them to feel closer to project teammates, so that the group work would feel less stressful and conflict-prone.

On thinking about the learnings from the debrief, and going back to the class discussions about design thinking, I had a few thoughts:

* In a "design thinking" approach, the first step is building empathy. This might have involved sending out the survey much in advance and perhaps to a wider group of people, and using the information collected to narrow down both on the problem statement and the theory of action. 
* The team engaged in smaller scale prototyping and testing their assumptions out to inform their design. This also reminds me of the iteration built into the "design thinking" process.
* Finally, I wonder if the timeline of the design and execution, along with the information base that the team started out with, called for a dynamic and adaptable framework, since they were piecing together understandings in real time by prototyping and keeping an active feedback loop alive.

However, having said this, I wonder how important it is for a team of learning designers to acknowledge explicitly what their framework of learning design is, if they are able to carry out the process in an organised, critical and reflective manner. I would still lean in favour of making the framework explicit, in order to ensure the learning design team is on the same page, but I can imagine scenarios in which an informal design process could be just as useful and productive.
