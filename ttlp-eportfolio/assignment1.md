## Learning Goals  
* **to understand** - Through the readings and class discussions, I want to familiarise myself with advancements in learning sciences, theories and epistemologies of knowledge. I want to explore them from contrasting perspectives and be able to argue for/against learning design decisions based on this understanding.
* **to connect** - I want to be able to connect learning design processes and decisions in the wild (past courses I have taken, courses I am currently enrolled in, informal learning opportunities) to what I learn in T127. I want to be able to answer the question: "What motivated this?" I also want to connect my experiences as a learner with the perspective of educators - and through this exercise, shape my system of beliefs about teaching and learning.
* **to apply** - Piaget and Vygotsky, both major scholars in developmental psychology, were in agreement that "we donâ€™t know what people know until we see them use it" [How People Learn, Unit 2.4.4]. My last goal is to evaluate whether I have understood and made connections, and to do so I must do something with what I learn. Hence, I want to practice designing and evaluating learning experiences in authentic settings, both in T127 and outside it.

## T127 Project
I am interested in the project that evaluates Foundations courses.
### Context
At the Harvard Graduate School of Education, there are many different Master's programs. My cohort met in the summer of 2022 to complete a "core curriculum" called Foundations, that every HGSE student from across every program has to enroll in. This was the first time that all students at HGSE had to take Foundations, and the Teaching and Learning Lab is working with the Foundations team to evaluate different aspects of the curriculum and how students received it.

### My Interest
I enjoyed the Foundations courses for the most part, and found them incredibly useful in getting situated to the program. During the summer months, Foundations brought my roommates and me together despite us being from different programs and backgrounds, and we enjoyed discussing what we liked and didn't like about our classes. I'm interested in seeing 
1) whether the broader cohort at HGSE enjoyed the Foundations courses and found them useful
2) what the "vision" of each Foundations course was, and what the faculty intended for us to learn
3) what gaps exist between the intended and actual effects, and how those can be bridged for the next cohort at HGSE
