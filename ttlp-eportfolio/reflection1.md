# Reflection: Behaviourism and Constructionism
The epistemologies (schools of thought for defining knowledge) and the class exercise that involved designing a learning experience based on a given theory, motivated me to think back to some of my past experiences as a learner. I am able to identify among them some instances of good and bad design, that knowingly or unknowingly (pun intended!) were based on these epistemologies.

## Behaviourism
My group had to come up with a way to teach a learner to drive a car, motivated by behaviourism. Before this, I had a negative outlook on how useful learning experiences based in behaviourism could be. Post engaging in this activity, I am able to understand that it may be useful in some well-defined contexts where the outcome is really far more significant and consequential that the journey - like in the case of learning how to drive safely.  
* As a learner of languages, I can vouch for the effectiveness of mobile applications like DuoLingo. However, I have noticed in myself a tendency to skip past reading the entire question and options if I know what the right answers are. I believe in some situations it is more useful to understand how to break down and truly understand the grammar of a foreign language, instead of just learning to replicate patterns.
* An example of assessments and teaching styles motivated by behaviourism, taken to the extreme, is nation-wide standardised testing. After graduating from high school in India, I had to attempt an engineering college entrance examination that students usually take 3-4 years to prepare for. The deep toxic consequences of these examinations are a matter of international discussion and debate, but it is clear that a behaviourist examination (multiple choice questions) is a bad choice in this context, because it encourages methods of study that have nothing to do with understanding or being able to apply concepts in the real world.

## Constructionism
* Project-based learning was a popular choice for my undergraduate Computer Science courses. Most often, some constraints were given to students but we were allowed to select projects that were meaningful to us. Often, in discussions with peers at the end of the semester, I would hear "We learned so much more through this project than through class lectures!" The projects were used both for formative and summative assessments as well - this learning experience is motivated by constructionism and in many cases, also paved the way for authentic learning.
* In one of my undergraduate courses, students could opt into working with a lab on the semester-long project, and my team chose to do this. We were introduced to the lab's work and asked to come up with project ideas within their focus area. Alternatively, we were able to continue working on a project that some students had started the previous year. We felt like we had been thrown into the deep end without being provided any documentation or guidance for exploring. We spent the semester trying to compile resources to understand the existing work - which in retrospect could have been very beneficial to the lab, but they seemed to be primarily interested in research output that could be published. I, and many students like me, internalised through experiences like these that if we were not working on algorithms or big data, we were not contributing to the field of research. This frames an example of constructionism gone wrong in two ways:
 * the lack of structure reduced learning outcomes - other teams who chose not to work with the lab had to work on an exemplar problem, which was highly structured and scaffolded but incredibly detailed and challenging; it seemed like those teams learned a lot more
 *  while the learning design seemed constructionist, the epistemology might not have been - the designers of the project believed in some form of objective truth - that some project outcomes were valid and others were not, and in this case it this propagated harmful stereotypes about research

Whole considering the last point, I was left with a question (which I believe is a commonly asked one): How do you evaluate student projects developed in response to a constructionist or constructivist learning activity, especially if the evaluation needs to be done on a scale?
