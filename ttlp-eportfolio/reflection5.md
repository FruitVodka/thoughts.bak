# Interviewing a MOOC Student

During the module on MOOCs and Open Learning, we participated in an activity that involved reviewing MOOC courses. I chose to explore MOOCs connected to topics that I already had some experience with, in order to review the courses in a short amount of time. I wondered what the experience of participating in a full-blown MOOC would have been like, and so I decided to have a conversation with a friend who had previously taken a MOOC course. I have recorded the conversation below:

Me: What is the name of the MOOC course that you took?
D: [Product Design: The Delft Design Approach](https://www.edx.org/course/product-design-the-delft-design-approach)
Me: How did you learn about this course, and what motivated you to take it?
D: Even in high school, I would often browse through platforms like EdX. I enrolled in many courses but never completed any of them. Eventually when I was doing my undergraduate studies in design, I found this course and was eager to take it because TU Delft is a top-tier institution and I wanted to experience their design education.
Me: Did you complete this course?
D: Yes, I completed it.
Me: Did you find this course more engaging than the ones you'd previously participated in?
D: Yes, the visual design of the course was appealing to me. Also, the activities were thoughfully designed. Another reason I completed this course was that I was learning similar things at college. It didn't feel as overwhelming as learning something completely new might have been. It also validated me as a designer that I was able to keep up with the course easily.
Me: Based on your experiences, what advice would you give someone looking to enroll in a MOOC course?
D: I would ask them to research how well-established a course is. The university matters, MOOC courses are a good way to get a sneak peek into how top universities teach. For example, I also took CS50x and it was an amazing experience for me. It helped me look forward to being a Harvard student. I also think community matters a lot in being able to complete a course.
Me: Thank you for sharing!

I think this conversation surfaced many themes similar to the ones discussed on the class Slack channel. It seems like MOOCs are most helpful as a supplementary form of learning and students are able to complete them when they already have prior knowledge on the subject and are loooking at completing the course as an additional credential. While MOOC courses might be useful to this very narrow segment of people, there is still a long way to go before they become accessible to learners who have a real need for open learning resources of high quality.
